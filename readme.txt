== Frequently asked questions ==

= My changes are not displayed on my website =

Browsers may cache Zotabox script to improve the website performance.
 
So to see your changes immediately, please select Refresh (ctrl F5) button on your Zotabox setting page to refresh your website cache.

= I would like to add Instagram to my social buttons =

Instagram only supports the ‘follow’ option, not sharing. Instagram also recently disallowed the ‘follow slider’ option.

= I would like to change what images/products facebook shares to my visitors =

Facebook automatically chooses what images etc to use when your visitors ‘share’ your website. You can ‘tell’ Facebook what images to share by using the following code. You may need a developer to help you.

= What is the difference between 'share' and 'follow' =

On some social tools you can choose to allow your customers to ‘share’ your website with their friends OR ‘follow’ your social account. For the ‘share’ option we do NOT need your social account information.
 
Currently, our social mobile tool only allows the ‘share’ option. The ‘follow’ option is available on our other social tools.

= My social buttons are not showing on mobile devices =

Please use our social mobile bar to display social buttons on mobile devices.
